# (string, int, float, lists, tuples, dictionary) -> types of variables
# dictionary is like a hash in perl -> key/value pairs, e.g., Honda Civic
#tuples and lists are like arrays
#float - decimals
#string - characters
# int - numbers
# Variables are case sensitive
# Integers are normally not in quotes, if you quote a number, e.g. 2 to "2", it becomes a string
# 2**8 - exponent -> 2 to the eight = 256
